#Time Your Trip Application
This application is still in development. It will be improved and added more features.


##What is Time Your Trip Application
This Android mobile application notifies bus passengers when they are arriving at their destination stop. It allows the user to spend the bus ride doing other activities, such as studying and sleeping, without having to constantly check the current stop and without fear of missing their destination stop. 
The app operates such that when the user gets on a bus, he or she will enter the starting stop he/she at, then the app will allow the user to choose the bus number and the destination stop. After that, it accesses real-time TransLink information to retrieve the estimated time it will take for the user to reach the chosen stop. Then, the app will set an alarm based on the retrieved time.

   2. In the Android SDK Manager, click the Tools menu and select Manage AVDs.
   3. In the Android Virtual Device Manager, select the emulator and click Start.
The app will be uploaded automatically and it can be tested starting by providing whatever expected.


* Through an actual android phone

You can download our app from [here](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.planmytrip.johan.planmytrip), or use Google Play and search "Time My Trip"

There are two folders that contain different tests for our application.

####Application Tests

*  Wait for it to be created then it should be seen on the window.
5. Click “OK”
6. The result will show at the bottom “Run:” console.


####Unit Tests
1.In the project source code, go to PlanMyTrip\app\src;
2.Under the “test” folder, click on the “java” then “com.example...”;
3.To run the unit tests, right click on the file and select “run ‘NameofTheTests’” ;

**alarmTimer**: this activity is responsible for turning on/off the alarm  
**Bus**: this activity is providing the user with infos regarding the bus(route, bus number,estimated leave time and the destination)  
**ConnectDatabase**: generate the list of the upcoming bus stops provided to the user  
**DatabaseAccess**: using the created database to send queries so that a listView can be generated  
**DatabaseOpenHelper**: creating the database  
**finalQuery**: not being used for the moment  
**GPSHandler**: is for checking how far the user is from their destination stop  
**MainActivity**: this activity is responsible for the launcher page, where the user is expected to enter the bus stop number he/she is at  
**NextBusesAdapter**: this activity is to generate the list view of the buses provided to the user after he entered the starting bus stop  
**Stop**: this activity will provide the location of the selected stop  
**TranslinkHandler**: this activity is where we are extracting the infos from translink API and parsing them to a JSON object or JSON array  
**TranslinkUI**: this activity is for providing the user with the buses that they can take from their starting location


##Design patterns used: 
* Observer pattern
As for the whole system, UI reflects the change of the states of the APP. Every time the state changes, it updates.
